# The study

* **What is the study about?**
  + This study examines the ways in which Cuban, Colombian, and Peninsular Spanish in Miami-Dade County (MDC) are conceptualized by Latinx participants in terms of implicit perceptions.
  
  + The authors examine how Latinx college students - all residents in Miami - perceive Spanish language variation in Miami and predict putative differences in two domains:
  
       - (1) personality characteristics related to warmth and competence traits.
       
       - (2) Differences in usage and maintenance of Spanish.
       
  + Data were analyzed for significance using a three by four within-subjects ANOVA with a series of specific statistical contrasts.

# The study

* **Research questions**

  + (1) How do Latinx college students in Miami perceive of three dialects of Spanish (Peninsular, Colombian, and Cuban) commonly heard in Miami in terms of warmth and competence traits?
  
  + (2) How do Latinx college students in Miami use these language varieties as perceptual cues to make predictive judgments about issues related to language, such as the maintenance or loss of Spanish in the United States?
  
  + (3) What contribution, if any, does non-linguistic social information play in the perception of language variation?

# Method

* **What did they do?**

  + In order to answer the three research questions, the authors conducted an experiment based on an online survey designed using Qualtrics.
  
  + This online survey consisted in a traditional perceptual dialectology study nestled within a social psychological experiment similar to that of a matched-guise.
  
  + Essentially, participants listened to recordings of three varieties of Spanish while being presented with information about the national origin of the speaker's family.
  
  + The survey consisted of over 100 questions.

# Method

* **How did they do it?**

  + Stimuli: 
  
       - The voices used as the instrument in the study came from recordings made with three male residents of Miami who were originally from Barcelona (Spain), Bogot√° (Colombia), and La Habana (Cuba).
    
       - All three speakers were college educated in their country of origin; were between the ages of 25 and 35; and lived in Miami. They had lived in the United States for at least one year.
    
       - The three speakers were given a brief passage to read aloud, which were digitally recorded using a ZOOM H1 handheld audio recorder. The passage was designed to include phonetic features of each of the Spanish dialects.
    
        - Sound files were edited in PRAAT to remove pauses and other disfluences and each recording was spliced to a similar length (~ 25 s).

# Method

* **How did they do it?**

  + Experiment: 
  
       - The experiment, programmed using Qualtrics, used a three by four (3 x 4) cell designed, where the three dialects (Peninsular, Colombian, and Cuban), considered "bottom-up stimuli", were paired with each of the four possible "top-down stimuli".
       
       - The top-down stimuli were the countries of origin for the ostensible speaker's parents, plus one condition in which no country of origin label was given. The stimuli are summarized in Table 1:

# Method

* **How did they do it?**

  + Experiment (continuation): 
  
       - The designed created a total of twelve possible bottom-up and top-down permutations.
       
       - The experimental manipulation in this study involved the matching and mismatching of the Spanish dialects ("bottom-up" stimulus) and the ostensible parental national-origin labels ("top-down" stimulus).
       
       - The top-down stimuli in the study were presented to the participants as the country of origin of the speakers' parents, in the form of "parents are from X" (see Table 3).
       
       - In some cases, the family background information matched the dialect of the speaker, and in others, the two stimuli were mismatched. In just one case per national origin variety, the top-down stimulus was omitted.

# Method

* **How did they do it?**

  + Experiment (continuation): 
  
       - The authors asked the participants to select, from a Likert scale, how likely it was that the speaker they had just heard had particular personality traits that represented both "competence" and "warmth".
       
       - In addition, the authors also asked the participants about how the voices they heard used language. Essentially, the asked a series of questions about whether or not the speakers would speak Spanish to their children, their future successes in learning English, how much TV the speakers watched in English, and whether or not the speakers' used Spanish in bilingual settings. A seven-point Likert-scale based on agreement was used for the language use/maintenance questions.

# Method

* **How did they do it?**

  + Statistical analysis:

       - The authors conducted a quantitative analysis of the data that consisted of a within-subjects ANOVA of the three by four matrix.
       
       - In order to control for statistical contrasts within the ANOVA, the authors freely estimated the outcome means and variance.
       
       - The statistical analysis was conducted using the structural equation modeling software Mplus (v7.4).
       
       - A total of seventeen models were created (one for each outcome) and missing data (at random) were accommodated by way of a maximum-likelihood estimation.
       
       - The authors computed standard errors with a sandwich estimator (MLR package).

# Method

* **Why did they do it?**

  + The authors of this paper used ANOVA to analyze their data because they were investigating the relationship between several independent variables and a single dependent variable. Specifically, they were interested in examining the effects of dialect variation, personal attributes, and language use on Latinx perception of Spanish in Miami.
  
  + We need to remember that ANOVA is a statistical test that is used to determine whether there are significant differences between the means of three or more groups. It allows researchers to compare the means of several groups and determine whether any observed differences are statistically significant. In this case, the authors used ANOVA to compare the means of different groups of participants based on their responses to survey questions.

# Appropriateness/novelty of analysis

* The ANOVA is an appropriate analyses in cases where the goal is to explore the relationship between several independent variables and a single dependent variable.

* Additionally, ANOVA allows for the examination of multiple independent variables simultaneously, which can help to identify complex relationships between variables. Overall, ANOVA was a suitable choice for the authors' research question and allowed them to draw meaningful conclusions from their data.

* Also, the statistical method used in this study was covered in our course.

# Presentation of results

* The authors presented, interpreted, and explained the results obtained in an appropriate and understandable manner. However, they did not make much reference to the statistical values obtained. In fact, only the p-value is reported, both in cases where there are significant effects between variables, and in those where there are not.

* The authors also used tables and graphs to represent the results obtained.   Despite their simplicity, they are all clear and very easy to understand. All the graphs are bar charts.

# Results

* Warmth/competence traits

  + Results of the ANOVA of the ratings of the three dialects show that the peninsular Spanish voice was rated significantly more competent as compared to the Colombian and Cuban speakers (p = 0.000).

# Results

* Warmth/competence traits

  + With respect to physical attractiveness, participants rated the Cuban voice significantly lower than the Colombian and Peninsular voices. This difference in perception was significant (p = 0.000).

# Results

* Perceptions of language use

  + Participants perceived the Colombian speaker to be more likely than the Cuban or Peninsular speakers to acquire English in this time. The difference was significant.

# Results

* Effect of "top-down" stimulus

  + Likelihood that the speaker is worried about losing their Spanish over time. Significant interaction between the national-origin label and the Spanish language varieties (p = 0.025).

# Results

* Effect of "top-down" stimulus

  + Likelihood that the speaker will choose Spanish in a bilingual setting. The labels had a significant effect (p = 0.002) on the perception of the dialect.

# Overall evaluation

* The authors used the appropriate statistic method to analyze their data and answer their research questions.

* The authors included a great variety of tables and graphs and help the interpretation of the results. Despite their simplicity, they are all clear and very easy to understand.

* However, the authors did not go into detail while reporting the statistical values obtained. They only reported the p-value.
